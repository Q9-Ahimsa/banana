# LOGBOOK — (project)
> Append-only chronology per the Logbook Standard v1 (shipped with this kit as
> `STANDARD.md`). Never edit or delete an entry — corrections are new entries
> carrying `SUPERSEDES:`. STATE.md is the projection; the logbook wins on
> conflict.

**Envelope:** `## [YYYY-MM-DD] {actor} {stream}.{n} | {TYPE} — {title}` +
prefix lines, body ≤ ~10 lines, pointers not payloads.

**TYPE vocabulary** (declared here; extend deliberately, in this block):
SESSION · DECISION · MILESTONE · PROBLEM · FIX · INSIGHT · RESEARCH · HANDOFF · CAPTURE

**Prefixes:** `WHAT:` / `WHY:` / `ref:` / `DONE:` / `NEXT:` / `BLOCKED:` /
`ASSUMED:` / `SUPERSEDES:`

**Read protocol:** the session entry ritual in `~/.agents/canon/CONTINUITY.md`
(via the kit's `brief` or its direct reads) — this line is a pointer, not the
ritual. Quick refs: STATE.md first, `grep "^## \[" LOGBOOK.md | tail -5`;
grep for specifics, never read the whole file.
